          ({formatInr(pricing.platinum.monthly)}/month or {formatInr(pricing.platinum.yearly)}/year) are paid in
          advance. Your plan is activated once we verify your payment, and its benefits run for one month or one year from that
          date, depending on the billing you chose. Plans do not renew automatically, so you are never charged again without
          choosing to. After a plan ends it keeps working for a grace period ({GRACE_DAYS.monthly} days for monthly,{" "}
          {GRACE_DAYS.yearly} days for yearly) so you can renew without interruption.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Unverified payment:</strong> if we cannot verify your payment and do not activate your plan, we refund the
            full amount.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Duplicate payment:</strong> if you were charged more than once for the same plan, we refund the extra
            amount.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Other requests</strong> are reviewed case by case. Because documents you create and download can&apos;t be
            returned, refunds for part of a month or year are not guaranteed.
