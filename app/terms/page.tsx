          {SITE.name} lets you create travel documents — hotel vouchers, air tickets, pickup vouchers, welcome placards,
          invoices, proforma invoices and receipts — and download or share them as PDFs.

          <strong>We are a software provider only.</strong> We are not a travel agent, airline, hotel or transport operator,
          and we are not a party to any booking between you and your customers or suppliers. You are solely responsible for
          the accuracy of every document you create and issue, including GST calculations and tax treatment on invoices.

            <strong>Silver</strong> is free. Documents stay open for {SILVER_RETENTION_DAYS} days from creation and are then
            locked (not deleted). PDFs carry a watermark, and upload auto-fill is limited per day.

            {formatInr(PAID_PLAN_PRICE_INR.platinum)} per year, inclusive of GST. Features and limits are shown on the
            pricing page.

          <li>
            Paid plans are paid in advance by UPI or bank transfer. After you submit your transaction ID and payment proof,
            we verify the payment and activate your plan. Benefits run for one year from activation.
          </li>
          <li>Paid plans do not renew automatically. When a plan ends, your account returns to Silver until you renew.</li>
          <li>
            We may change prices for future periods with at least 30 days&apos; notice. A price change never affects a
            period you have already paid for.
